# DANCE (Data-driven Augmented Negative Control Estiamtion)

## About the Project

Negative controls are used to adjust for unmeasured confounding bias in causal inference for observational data.
We present a data-driven automated algorithm of statistical tests for discovering 'disconnected negative controls' that can serve as surrogates of unmeasured confounder.
